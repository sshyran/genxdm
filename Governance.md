# Voting #

We follow Apache rules for voting. See [Apache Voting Process](http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html).

To summarize: For any given topic, you can vote +1, 0, or -1. There are three categories: procedural, for which majority rules are in force (more +1 than -1); code modification, for which any -1 is a veto; and release, for which there must be three binding +1 votes (releases may not be vetoed). For our purposes, releases must also have a majority (Apache rules are somewhat different, but work out to about that).  Only binding votes need be counted, but attention should be given to advisory votes.

Approval (+1) and abstention (0) require no explanation.  Negative votes **must** include a reason; that reason ought to provide enough information for others to address the issue raised.

Committers have binding votes.  All other votes (contributors, as well as anyone else who cares to express an opinion on the official mailing list) are considered advisory.  In some circumstances, a vote may be called with the franchise extended to those who are not normally considered to have binding votes.

Note that, in Apache terms, committers use C-T-R; contributors R-T-C.
