# Participation: Policies and Processes #

The GenXDM project follows, insofar as it is able outside the incubator, the
policies and processes of the Apache organization.  Everything happens openly,
on the mailing list.  Decisions are made there, either by consensus or by
formal vote.

## Becoming an Auditor ##

Watch the mailing list, the website, the code ... observe.  :-)

## Becoming a Correspondent ##

Subscribe to the mailing list.  Join the conversation.  Also, watch the issue
tracker.  Significant design decisions are typically brought to the mailing
list, with a call for discussion, but they are also tracked in the issue
tracker.  Some discussion inevitably happens thereâ€”and is reflected to
the mailing list.  Some smaller design or implementation decisions may not
be brought formally to the mailing list, but will be reflected there by
the issue tracker, and those interested in discussing the issue are encouraged
to respond on the mailing list if they cannot comment in the issue tracker.

## Becoming a Contributor ##

Becoming a contributor to the project requires no formal approval.  Supply
something useful to an existing project member, and that member will (or
**should**) add your name to the list of contributors, assuming that the
requirements for contribution have been met (basically: a willingness to
apply the standard copyright and license header; adequate quality and utility).
Any committer can note a person as a contributor (such a note may be
challenged by another committer, but only on the grounds that the copyright
or license requirements have not been met).

Auditors, correspondents, and contributors all have 'advisory' votes, for
proposals (posted to the mailing list) in which a distinction is made between
advisory and binding.  Some proposals may extend suffrage (binding votes) to
contributors or to all interested, but most formal votes will be left to
the full members of the project.

## Becoming a Committer ##

A committer is a full member of the project, with binding votes.  An
existing contributor may be proposed as committer by any existing committer.
At present, this will mean that discussion of the proposal happens on the
public mailing list, so kindly remain courteous and professional in the
discussion.

New committer proposals should provide forty-eight to seventy-two hour response
blocks.  The proposal should include a pointer to a repository commit (or to
more than one) which represent the candidate's contributions (revision numbers
are adequate information).  See [Governance](Governance.md) for details on voting.

Not all committers need be developers, although it is expected that most will
be.  Proposals for candidates who are not developers must supply information
equivalent to code contribution (why should this contributor be a committer?).
If someone ought to be a full member, but does not need commit privileges,
we will need to discuss (and vote on) a new category of full members.
